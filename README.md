# React Mirror Repository

This repository maintains an automated mirror of the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) repository.

## Repository Structure

- `main` branch: Contains this README and the GitHub Actions workflow
- `mirror` branch: Contains the actual mirrored React codebase

## Mirror Details

## How It Works

The mirroring process is automated using GitHub Actions:
1. Runs daily at 02:00 UTC
2. Fetches the latest React codebase
3. Updates the `mirror` branch
4. Updates mirror information

To clone the mirrored repository:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zaid-maker/react-mirror.git
cd react-mirror

# Switch to the mirror branch
